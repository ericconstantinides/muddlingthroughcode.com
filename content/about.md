## What is this?

This is me being me. ðŸ™ˆ

I'm tired of reading articles where it sounds like everything is soooo friggin' easy for everybody. Guess what, it's not. Sometimes it's hard. Sometimes even the smartest devs muddle. This site is my journey to learn and grow, and to occasionally muddle through code. I don't want to muddle forever, but sometimes you gotta do it just to learn.
